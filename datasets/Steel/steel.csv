An EOS M290 system was used to build the ɸ12 × 120 mm Corrax steel cylinders on top of 420 under an Argon atmosphere using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique. The laser power, scanning speed, hatching distance and layer thickness were 258.7 W, 1066.7 mm/s, 100 µm, and 30 µm, respectively. The laser beam was rotated 67° between successive layers during the process. The platform temperature was kept at 80 °C during the printing process to reduce the residual stresses at the interface. The commercial heat treatment of 420 steel includes austenitization at 1010–1030 °C followed by tempering at 230–300 °C, while the heat treatment of Corrax includes austenitization at approximately 900 °C followed by aging at 500–550 °C. In this work, we examined combinations of austenitization and aging temperatures and concluded that a hybrid heat treatment cycle in an Argon atmosphere optimizes mechanical properties and compatibility between 420 and Corrax steels. We chose the 420 austenitization temperature and the Corrax aging temperature as described in the following. The hybrid steel was heated at 15 °C/min to the maximum temperature of 1010 °C and then held for 30 min, followed by quenching with high-pressure Argon, to obtain a fully martensitic matrix.
